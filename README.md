# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This website was created to help me organize my notes from the Prework and ideas that I had while working through each section.

My intention is to have a dedicated space to store what I learned so that I can remember as much as possible from the lessons, as well as put that information into practice. I learned how to create a framework for webpages with HTML, add style to make pages pretty with CSS, and use JavaScript to make pages interactive.

Each section of the Prework Study Guide contains notes about a certain topic, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If you open the console, you can see the JavaScript running. Each topic to study from the prework is listed, and the JavaScript will choose a topic at random for us to study.
